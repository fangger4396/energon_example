## Example of extracting data from raw EMSD data
Here, we provide an example to show how to extract the data you can use to train the cooling load prediction model in the competition from the **raw EMSD data**. 
## The raw EMSD data
The raw EMSD data is different from what you recived from the organizers of the competition which can directly used for model training. The raw EMSD data is much more complex and coarse. Thus, we firstly give a full view of the raw EMSD data.

The raw EMSD data are collected by multiple sensors which distribute in different systems (e.g., Chillers, AHUs, Boilers, etc.) in the EMSD building and are varying in types (e.g., temperature, humidity, flow rate, etc.).
