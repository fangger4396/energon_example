# Two Cases of Real-world Buidling Analytics
## Two real-world building datasets
We firstly show two real-world building datasets. One is the **DP** dataset which consists of serveral tables (stored as multiple .csv files) and each table stores the data collected from an independent sensor of the building DP. Another is the **EMSD** dataset which is a single super table (stored as a single .csv file) and all the data collected by different sensors of building EMSD are concated by raws together. Both of them can be used 

**a figure to show the different data files**

In fact, we can never expect that all the real-world datasets to be construted by the above methods. Without constraints, the organization of building datasets can be arbitrary. For example, the datasets can also be a single table and all the data from different sensors are concated by columns as follows. Thus, it comes more difficult when the number of buildings becomes multiple.
