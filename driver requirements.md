## Procedure for building analytics

# Method for Building Data Accessing
## Two real-world buidling dataset
We firstly show two real-world building datasets. One is the **DP** dataset which consists of serveral tables (stored as .csv files) and each table stores the data collected from an independent sensor of the building DP. Another is the **EMSD** dataset which is a single super table and all the data collected by different sensors of building EMSD are concated together.

In fact, we can never expect that all real-world datasets to be construted by the above methods. Without constraints, the organization of building datasets can be arbitrary. 
## Manual way

## Metadata-scheme based way

## Deficiencies for multiple buildings
