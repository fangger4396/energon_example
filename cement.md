# Building Application Introduction
Building Applications are widely used in building energy tracing, fault detection and equipment control, which are always developed in data-driven manner today. Here, we firstly introduce the application named **Energy Consumption Predition (ECP)**, and then show how two different building datasets can be used for this application.
## Energy Consumption Prediction
The Energy Consumption Prdiction can be used to predict the next timestamp energy consumption of a group of building systems by training a ML model with histrical electricity data of the related systems. Here, a general ML model construction process can be followed to get this model, which consists of data access, data processing, model training, model evaluation orderly.
## Building Datasets Introduction
Besides the EMSD data, we also provide an open-source dataset named **Genome**. 
## Model Introduction

# Case Study
## Case 1: Using Genome Data with Brick
## Case 2: Using Genome Data with Energon
## Case 3: Using EMSD Data with Brick
